# Game-of-Blocks
Repository to track and store the code I write during my project under the SnT Council, known as "Game of Blocks".

# Assignment1
This program accepts a string input from the user and then concatenates a positive integer to the end, till the new string's SHA256 hash value becomes lower than that of a given
value, i.e., 0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. It also outputs the time taken to traverse from 1 to the required number. This is basically how a
crypto miner works on the fundamental level.
